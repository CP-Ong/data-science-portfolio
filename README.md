# Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio includes my projects in data science.

### Project 1: Early Warning Modelling for Running Injury Risk &nbsp; | &nbsp; [<ins>See Here!</ins>](Running-Injury-Risk)
  > Built an early-warning injury risk model using wearable training data to identify high-risk periods before injuries occur. The project focuses on transforming raw daily training metrics into interpretable injury risk scores that could be used in a consumer fitness or sports analytics product.

The original data came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/injury-prediction-for-competitive-runners).
